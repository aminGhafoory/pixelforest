# 🌲 Pixel Forest  
*A Tile-Crawling Adventure Boardgame*  

## 📖 Overview  
Pixel Forest is a tile-based dungeon crawler where players race to their destinations through a mysterious forest. Each tile has 25 cells that can be **paths** or **obstacles**. Players roll dice to move, draw tiles to expand the forest, and strategically block or open routes.  

---

## 🎲 Components  
- **Tile Deck** – stack of forest tiles (25 cells each)  
- **Dice** – 1 six-sided die  
- **Player Tokens** – 1 per player  
- **Destination Markers** – 1 per player  

---

## ⚔️ Setup  
1. Shuffle the stack of tiles.  
2. Place the **starting tile** in the center of the table.  
3. Each player puts their token on the starting cell.  
4. Assign each player a destination.

## 🚶 Gameplay  
Each round has 3 steps:  

1. **Roll the Dice 🎲**  
   - Roll to see how many cells you may move this turn.  

2. **Draw & Place a Tile 🧩**  
   - Draw the top tile from the stack.  
   - Place it **adjacent** to any existing tile.  

3. **Move 🏃**  
   - Move up to the number rolled, only along **path cells**.  
   - You may move fewer steps.  

---

## 🏁 Winning  
The first player to reach their **destination tile** wins the game!  

---

## 🔑 Strategy  
- Place tiles to block rivals or open shortcuts.  
- Sometimes defense is better than speed.  
- Path-building choices are often more important than dice rolls.
